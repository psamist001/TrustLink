# TrustLink Security Audit Scope

**Project:** TrustLink - On-Chain Attestation & Verification System  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Blockchain:** Stellar Soroban  
**Audit Type:** Pre-Mainnet Security Audit  
**Prepared:** March 26, 2026  

---

## Executive Summary

TrustLink is a Soroban smart contract providing a reusable trust layer for the Stellar blockchain. It enables authorized issuers to create, manage, and revoke attestations about wallet addresses, allowing other contracts and applications to verify claims before executing financial operations.

This audit scope document defines the boundaries, objectives, and deliverables for a comprehensive security review of TrustLink before mainnet deployment with real funds.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
TrustLink solves decentralized identity verification and trust establishment on-chain. Instead of each application building its own KYC/verification system, TrustLink provides shared attestation infrastructure queryable by any smart contract.

### Key Features
- **Authorized Issuers:** Admin-controlled registry of trusted attestation issuers
- **Claim Type Registry:** Admin-managed registry of standard claim types with descriptions
- **Flexible Claims:** Support for any claim type (KYC_PASSED, ACCREDITED_INVESTOR, MERCHANT_VERIFIED, etc.)
- **Expiration Support:** Optional time-based expiration for attestations
- **Historical Import:** Admin can import externally verified attestations with original timestamps
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Support:** Trusted bridge contracts can bring attestations from other chains on-chain
- **Configurable Fees:** Admin can require a token-denominated fee for native attestation creation
- **Revocation:** Issuers can revoke attestations at any time
- **Deterministic IDs:** Attestations have unique, reproducible identifiers
- **Event Emission:** All state changes emit events for off-chain indexing
- **Multi-Sig Support:** M-of-N issuer co-signing for high-value claims
- **GDPR Compliance:** Soft-delete mechanism for right to erasure
- **Pagination:** Efficient listing of attestations per subject or issuer

### Deployment Target
- **Mainnet:** Stellar Production Network
- **Real Funds:** Yes - fee collection and potential token transfers
- **User Impact:** High - affects KYC/verification for regulated financial protocols

## 3. Security Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives

1. **Authorization Correctness**
   - Verify all functions enforce correct access control
   - Confirm admin, issuer, and subject roles are properly scoped
   - Validate that de-registered issuers cannot perform privileged actions
   - Ensure multi-sig thresholds are correctly enforced

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Confirm deterministic ID generation prevents collisions
   - Verify attestation immutability (only revoked flag and expiration can change)
   - Validate storage key isolation and no cross-contamination
   - Ensure pagination logic handles edge cases correctly

3. **State Consistency**
   - Verify batch operations are atomic or fail safely
   - Confirm event emission matches state changes
   - Validate that pause mechanism blocks all write operations
   - Ensure TTL expiry doesn't cause data loss or inconsistency

4. **Threat Model Coverage**
   - Prevent unauthorized issuance
   - Prevent self-attestation
   - Prevent replay attacks
   - Prevent admin impersonation
   - Prevent issuer bypass after de-registration
   - Prevent unauthorized revocation
   - Prevent unauthorized admin transfer

5. **Compliance & Privacy**
   - Verify GDPR right to erasure implementation
   - Confirm data minimization practices
   - Validate deletion event emission for off-chain compliance
   - Ensure no PII leakage in on-chain data

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives

1. **Operational Security**
   - Assess admin key compromise impact
   - Evaluate emergency pause effectiveness
   - Review incident response capabilities
   - Validate monitoring and alerting requirements

2. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Assess gas efficiency of operations
   - Evaluate pagination performance
   - Review batch operation limits
   - Validate storage TTL impact on long-term operations

3. **Known Issues Resolution**
   - Verify three pre-identified HIGH/MEDIUM findings are fixed:
     - FINDING-001: `initialize()` state read before auth
     - FINDING-002: `revoke_attestation()` missing `require_issuer` check
     - FINDING-003: `update_expiration()` missing `require_issuer` check

---

## 4. Known Issues & Pre-Audit Findings

### 4.1 Pre-Audit Security Review (March 25, 2026)

A preliminary authorization audit identified three findings that must be resolved before mainnet deployment:

#### FINDING-001 [MEDIUM] — `initialize()` State Read Before Auth
**Location:** `src/admin.rs` — `initialize()` (delegated from `src/lib.rs`)  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** `Storage::has_admin()` was called before `admin.require_auth()`, violating the principle that authorization must precede all state interaction.  
**Recommendation:** Move `require_auth()` to the first line.  
**Resolution:** `require_auth()` is now the first statement in `initialize()`, before any storage read. Covered by `test_second_initialize_from_any_address_rejected` in `src/test.rs`.

#### FINDING-002 [HIGH] — `revoke_attestation()` Missing `require_issuer` Check
**Location:** `src/lib.rs` — `revoke_attestation()`  
**Status:** Open  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Function lacks `Validation::require_issuer()` check. De-registered issuers can still revoke their attestations.  
**Recommendation:** Add `Validation::require_issuer(&env, &issuer)?;` after `require_auth()`.

#### FINDING-003 [HIGH] — `update_expiration()` Missing `require_issuer` Check
**Location:** `src/lib.rs` — `update_expiration()`  
**Status:** Open  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Function lacks `Validation::require_issuer()` check, inconsistent with `renew_attestation()`. De-registered issuers can extend expiration indefinitely.  
**Recommendation:** Add `Validation::require_issuer(&env, &issuer)?;` after `require_auth()`.

### 4.2 Known Limitations (Documented)

These are architectural limitations that are acceptable but should be understood:

- **Admin Key Compromise:** Single point of failure; mitigated by multisig account
- **Issuer Key Compromise:** No rate limiting or per-issuer caps
- **No On-Chain Claim Type Validation:** Registry is informational only
- **Metadata Unverified:** Free-form string, no content validation
- **Storage TTL Expiry:** Entries evicted after 30 days of inactivity
- **Expiration Hook Callback Trust:** Arbitrary external contract calls
- **Bridge Contract Trust:** Binary (all-or-nothing), no per-bridge claim type restrictions
- **No Subject Consent:** Subjects cannot reject attestations
- **Batch Pause Gap:** `create_attestations_batch` not pause-gated
