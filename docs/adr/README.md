# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for TrustLink.
An ADR captures a significant design choice, the context that drove it, and
the trade-offs accepted as a result.

- **Decision** — What was decided and how it works
- **Consequences** — Trade-offs, benefits, and known limitations
